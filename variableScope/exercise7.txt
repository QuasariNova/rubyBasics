What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have 
tried to answer.

  a = 7
  array = [1, 2, 3]

  array.each do |element|
    a = element
  end

  puts a

3
This is now using a block instead of a method. Blocks have access to variables 
scoped in higher levels, so this will assign 1, then 2, and finally 3 to a, 
which it then prints to the screen.
