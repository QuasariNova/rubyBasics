What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have 
tried to answer.

  a = "Xyzzy"

  def my_value(b)
    b = 'yzzyX'
  end

  my_value(a)
  puts a

Xyzzy

This outputs that because, while we passed the string to the my_value method 
and it can be mutated, assigning a new string to a variable does not mutate the 
string that was previously referenced by that variable.
