What will the following code print and why? Don't run it until you have tried 
to answer.

a = 7

def my_value(b)
  b += 10
end

my_value(a)
puts a

It will output 7. The method my_value does not change a, which it really 
couldn't since a is in another scope. b points to a at first, but once it's 
modified, it points to another point in memory equaling 17. Since a isn't 
changed, 7 gets output at the end.
