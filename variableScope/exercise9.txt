What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have 
tried to answer.

  a = 7
  array = [1, 2, 3]

  array.each do |a|
    a += 1
  end

  puts a

7
The array defines another variable named a in it's inner scope. Due to this, it 
overrides the outer scope's a inside the block and doesn't apply anything to 
it. As such a in the outer scope stays 7.

The solution introduces the word Shadowing to describe this.
