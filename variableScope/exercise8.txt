What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have 
tried to answer.

  array = [1, 2, 3]

  array.each do |element|
    a = element
  end

  puts a

This will not complete running. a is not initialized in the outer scope, so a 
being initialized in the blocks scope only applies to the block. As such when 
we try to puts a, it can't find a variable with that name and throws an error.
