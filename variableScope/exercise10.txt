What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have 
tried to answer.

  a = 7
  array = [1, 2, 3]

  def my_value(ary)
    ary.each do |b|
      a += b
    end
  end

  my_value(array)
  puts a

This program will not finish running. While a is referenced inside a block and 
a block could have access to variables above it's scope, the block occurs in a 
method which doesn't have access to variables outside it's scope. The block 
would only have access to variables declared inside the method, and have no 
idea what variables exist outside that.
