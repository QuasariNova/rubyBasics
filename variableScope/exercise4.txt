What will the following code print, and why? Don't run the code until you have 
tried to answer.

  a = "Xyzzy"

  def my_value(b)
    b[2] = '-'
  end

  my_value(a)
  puts a

Xy-zy is what is output. When you pass a string, it's really passing a pointer 
to the start of the string in address memory. Altering the string mutates it 
for all references, while initializing a new string wouldn't effect other 
strings. Since we are changing the character at index 2, this mutates the 
string passed to the method, giving us Xy-zy.

Instead of explaining memory as I'm not 100% on that, it's probably better to 
explain it as numbers being immutable and strings not.
