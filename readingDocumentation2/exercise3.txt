Assume you have the following code:

  s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
  puts s.split.inspect
  puts s.split(',').inspect
  puts s.split(',', 2).inspect

What will each of the 3 puts statements print?

s.split by default separates substrings by ' ' characters. So the first puts 
statement should output

  ['abc', 'def', 'ghi,jkl', 'mno', 'pqr,stu', 'vwx', 'yz']

The second changes the field_sep parameter to ',', which means it will separate 
the string by ',' instead of ' ' giving us this output:

  ['abc def ghi', 'jkl mno pqr', 'vwx yz']

The third sets the limit parameter, this makes it out put a number of strings 
in the array <= the limit parameter. This means it performs limit - 1 splits. 
In this case, it will split at the first comma and leave the rest of the string 
as is. The output should be:

  ['abc def ghi', 'jkl mno pqr,vwx yz']
