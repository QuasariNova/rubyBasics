Assume you have this Array:

  a = %w(a b c d e)

How would you use Array#insert to insert the numbers 5, 6, and 7 between the 
elements with values 'c' and 'd'?

This evaluates as :
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

'c' is at index 2(which is 3 from the end) and 'd' is at index 3. You could 
call this method one of two ways. Either:

  a.insert(3, 5, 6, 7)

or:
  
  a.insert(-3, 5, 6, 7)
