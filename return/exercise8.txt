What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def count_sheep
    5.times do |sheep|
      puts sheep
    end
    10
  end

  puts count_sheep

Probable Output:
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  10

This is just like exercise7, but instead of the last expression of the 
count_sheep method being the Integer#times method, it is the literal 10. This 
means that 10 will be returned implicitly and passed to the last puts. So the 
count_sheep method prints 0, 1, 2, 3, then 4 on their own lines and the final 
puts prints 10.
