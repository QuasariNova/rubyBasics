What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def meal
    'Dinner'
    puts 'Dinner'
  end

  p meal

Output should be:
Dinner
nil

The meal method's first line, while evaluating to 'Dinner' does effect the 
methods return value as it's not the last line. The puts after it will display 
Dinner on the screen and then return nil. Since meal was invoked and passed to 
the p method, that means nil will be printed to the screen after Dinner.
