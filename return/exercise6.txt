What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def meal
    return 'Breakfast'
    'Dinner'
    puts 'Dinner'
  end

  puts meal

Output probably is:

  Breakfast

The program invokes the meal method then passes it to a puts method. The meal 
method explicitly returns 'Breakfast' before doing anything else, so that is 
all the method does. 'Breakfast' is passed to the puts, so it will be printed 
on the screen.
