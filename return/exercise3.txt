What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def meal
    return 'Breakfast'
    'Dinner'
  end

  puts meal

The meal method explicitly returns 'Breakfast', so it will never implicitly 
return 'Dinner'. The puts method at the end is passed the return of meal, so 
Breakfast will be output on the screen.
