What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

def tricky_number
  if true
    number = 1
  else
    2
  end
end

puts tricky_number

Output should be:

  1

The if in tricky_number will always evaluate as true, so the final expression 
of the method will always be number = 1. Assignment evaluates as the value on 
the right side, so it will implicitly return 1. puts is passed this, so it 
prints 1 to the screen.
