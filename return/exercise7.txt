What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def count_sheep
    5.times do |sheep|
      puts sheep
    end
  end

  puts count_sheep

Output Probably:

  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5

  The program begins by invoking count_sheep to pass it's return value to puts. 
  The count_sheep method uses the Integer#times method to iterate over 0...
  integer in this case it stores the current iterator in sheep and puts that 
  value, thus printing on a new line each 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Integer#times 
  method returns the Caller, in this case the integer literal 5. This is the 
  last expression in the method, thus is returned by count_sheep and passed to 
  the puts method, printing 5 on the screen.
