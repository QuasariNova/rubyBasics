What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def meal
    puts 'Dinner'
    return 'Breakfast'
  end

  puts meal

The output would be like this:

  Dinner
  Breakfast

Our program starts by calling the puts method and passing it the value returned 
after invoking the meal method. The meal method first prints 'Dinner' to the 
screen, then it explicitly returns 'Breakfast'. 'Breakfast' gets passed to the 
puts method and outputs 'Breakfast' to the screen.
