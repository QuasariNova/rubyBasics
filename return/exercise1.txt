What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  def meal
    return 'Breakfast'
  end

  puts meal

The last line calls the puts method, passing the value returned by invoking 
meal. The meal method explicitly returns the string 'Breakfast', so Breakfast 
will be printed to the screen.
