Using the ruby documentation, determine how you can write large numbers in a 
way that makes them easier to read.

Under the literals page it says:
 
 The underscore may be used to enhance readability for humans. You may place an 
 underscore anywhere in the number.

So you may write a number where the _ is where a comma would be. 9 million 
could be 9_000_000 and still be valid syntax.
