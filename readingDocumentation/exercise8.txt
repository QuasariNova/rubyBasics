Use the ruby documentation for the String class to determine which method can 
be used to right justify a String object.

String#rjust is the method to be used to right justify a string. It takes an 
integer, which is how many characters to pad on the left side of the string. It 
also takes an optional string parameter to choose what the padding is. By 
default the padding is a ' '.
