Using the ruby documentation, determine how you would write a Symbol that 
represents your name. We aren't looking for a String; we want a Symbol, which 
is one of ruby's datatypes.

In the literals page, it says that you can define a symbol by :"name" if the 
name used to define the symbol has no spaces, you can leave off the ". It works 
with string interpolation too.
