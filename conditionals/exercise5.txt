What will the following code print? Why? Don't run it until you've attempted to 
answer.

  number = 7

  if number
    puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
  else
    puts "I don't have a favorite number."
  end

Output should be:

  My favorite number is 7.

Since anything that is not false or nil evaluates as true, this would run the puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
