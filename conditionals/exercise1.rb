#In the code below, sun is randomly assigned as 'visible' or 'hidden'.
# 
# sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample
# 
# Write an if statement that prints "The sun is so bright!" if sun equals 
#'visible'.

sun = ['visible', 'hidden'].sample

if sun == 'visible'
  puts "The sun is so bright!"
end

# I'd rather put the if at the end, but feel like this will be built on.
